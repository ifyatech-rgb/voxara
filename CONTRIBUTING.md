## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep components small and focused

## Testing

Before submitting:
- Test all user flows
- Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run build`
- Verify database migrations work
- Test on different screen sizes

## Phase 2 Implementation

When implementing video generation:

1. Review `app/api/scripts/[id]/generate-video/route.ts` for implementation guide
2. Test with HeyGen API sandbox first
3. Handle errors gracefully
4. Update script status appropriately
5. Add loading states in UI
